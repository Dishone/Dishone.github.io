Corrupt binary codes infecting my mind

perform invocation with numbing freeze

Querying for a variable and seizing the time

to recompile and trigger my destiny

Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid

I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed

There is no "exception" in this library

for I know I will always go with you

Superhot projectiles pierce the wind

I charged up my armor into lightspeed

Querying for a variable and seizing the time

in a new day coming not so far away

Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid

I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed

There is no "exception" in this library

for I know I will always go with you

Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid

I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed

There is no "exception" in this library

for I know I will always go with you

Though my wings’ve been bloodstained and could never rid

I'll try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed

There is no "exception" in this library

for I know I will always go with my heart
